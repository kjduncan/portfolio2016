			<p>Currently freelancing in Boulder, Colorado, I use web technologies to solve complex problems.
		    I appreciate charmingly simple, intuitive interfaces and always keep the user in mind.
		  </p>
			<p>I am a recent graduate of Skillcrush Web Developer Blueprint Boot Camp; a current WebLab student at
				 Front Range Community college; and I have completed several courses on Codecademy in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
			</p>
		  <p>When I'm not making awesome websites, you can find me in the mountains or the city,
		    exploring with my man and baby girl.

<div class="holstee-description modal">
	<p>This is a project that I worked on for the Skillcrush Web Developer Blueprint. The task was to utilize
		 our newfound knowledge of span tags to style a version of the Holstee Manifesto. An additional, optional challenge
		 was to attempt to make our Manifesto look as close to the original as possible. This was the route I took and,
		 while there are some minor spacing issues, I think mine turned out pretty well. It was challenging for me at
		 first to figure out how to avoid redundancies in my code and I still think that is something that can be improved in this project.

<div class="resume-description modal">
		<p>This is a project that I worked on in the HTML/CSS portion of the Skillcrush Web Developer Blueprint.
			We were required to code a resume website based on a pdf file using HTML and CSS. The goal was to make the site
			look as similar to the pdf as possible. I enjoyed making adjustments to my code along the way and trying different
			style techniques to match my website to the pdf file. This was my first experience trying to code a website from a pdf
			file and I am very proud of how it turned out.

<div class="alice-description modal">
		<p>This is a project I worked on in the HTML portion of Weblab Development Bootcamp. The task was to create a webpage that displayed
		several chapters of Alice in Wonderland and linked them together in a table of contents. I was excited to think of a layout and try
		some different css to add cool features.</p>
